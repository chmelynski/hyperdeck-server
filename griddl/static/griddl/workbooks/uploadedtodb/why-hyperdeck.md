# Welcome to Hyperdeck!

Hyperdeck is a notebook programming environment for making documents.

If I had to do describe it in an X-for-Y way, the most technically accurate would be JSFiddle for LaTeX (although PDF support is not quite here yet).

Another way to describe it would be Excel/Word/Powerpoint but using web technologies.  Different form, but same goals.

### Why Hyperdeck?

Of course, Google already has Google Docs - how is this different?  Well, I think Google Docs follows the same basic form as Microsoft Office - it's a defensive, me-too app rather than an attempt to make fundamental advances.

Hyperdeck is what you get when you attempt to redesign the canonical office apps to take full advantage of the modern browser.

First of all, let me ask a question - why are spreadsheets, word processors, and presentation editors different apps?  The answer is simply path dependence - they started as different apps back in the 70s and 80s, and have mostly stayed that way.

Certainly Microsoft has made valiant attempts at getting their office apps to play nicely with each other, but ultimately they're fighting against fundamental elements of the design.

**Hyperdeck seeks to unify spreadsheets, word processors, and presentation editors into a single app, built on modern, open, extensible web technologies.**

The same is true for scriptability.  Visual Basic for Applications was not part of the original Excel - it was added on as a sort of separate module in 1990.  It works!  The world still runs on Excel/VBA.  But again, getting the two parts to play well together requires fighting the inherent separateness of the apps.

**Hyperdeck seeks to integrate scriptability as a first-class citizen along with direct and indirect ways of editing documents.**

Microsoft Office has an ecosystem of add-ons.  I don't know how to get one.  Ok, to be fair, I could figure it out.  Still, I'm almost certain that whatever system Office uses is beaten by the humble link.  Javascript is eating the world - for almost anything you can imagine, there is a javascript library available on the web.  Many of these libraries can be installed with a simple link.  VBA has its partisans, but ultimately VBA is the past.  Javascript (and other languages that can be made to run in the browser) is the future.

**Hyperdeck can be extended by any code library that can run in the browser.**
