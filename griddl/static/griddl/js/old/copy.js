	// for pasting outside the program, we'll need to follow some variant of this procedure:
	// 1. on Ctrl, convert selection to text and fill a hidden textbox (we can have a brace of 12 or something) with the text, and select it
	// 2. then on C, we can fill the internal clipboard with that same text - the browser/OS will hijack the Ctrl+C combo and copy the text in the hidden textbox
	
	// the downside of this is that we have to convert the selection to text on every Ctrl, on the off chance it may be followed by C
	// this is inefficient, possibly fatally if the selection is large
	
	// yet another issue involves the various structures that can be copied, and how to store them and paste them correctly
	// for instance, we could paste into a different structure and do the structural conversion automatically
	
	//var text = "foo\tbar";
	//window.prompt("Copy to clipboard: Ctrl+C, Enter", text);
	// this prompt textbox is hidden/displayed independently of any Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V actions
	// but it always displays the current clipboard
	// so to paste something from the outside, display the textbox, then focus on it and paste in from the external clipboard
	// that will overwrite globals.clipboard
	// then focus on the canvas, and hit Ctrl+V to paste
