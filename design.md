# Hyperbench: Design and Implementation


#### Components

The heart of Hyperbench is Components.  Each component is a self-contained unit that holds data, exposes an interface for manipulating that data, and possibly draws itself onto the document canvas.  Components are displayed on the left side of the screen in a vertical stack.

The user interface of each component has a header and a body.  The header holds common UI elements like handles for reordering, a type label, a name input, action buttons, upload/download buttons, and minimize/destroy buttons.  The body can be arbitrary HTML - the body is how the user manipulates the data held by the component.  This data can be arbitrary JSON, but two common forms are text and tabular data.  Text is often displayed in a CodeMirror widget, and tabular data is often displayed in a Handsontable widget.

All Components must define certain functions such as:

* `load()` - read?  i think the constructor is doing the work of load in a lot of places
* `write()` - export to JSON
* `add()` - add component to the stack, which is a transaction of sorts - several linked components
* `refresh()` - regenerates the HTML user interface after setting data/params
* `getText()` - returns the full JSON for the component
* `setText()` - sets component JSON
* `getData()` - returns the `data` field
* `setData()` - sets the `data` field

New Components can be written as plugins - the Component must implement the required functions and fields.


##### File format

Hyperbench documents are stored in JSON format, as a list of component objects.  Each component JSON will have several of these fields:

* `type` - `txt`, `grid`, `document`, etc.
* `name`
* `visible` - determines whether the component is displayed as maximized or minimized
* `data` - varies by type - text components will store their text here, and grid components will store a list of objects or lists.  in general, the meat of the component will be stored here
* `params` - stores everything else, frequently exposed by the component UI


##### Text

Components whose data is best represented as text will display that text in a Codemirror instance.  Salient example types include `text`, `js`, `html`, and `css`.  Many other component types will not display their data as text by default, but can be toggled to present a text display for user editing.  For example, grids may be toggled to display their tabular data as tab-separated values in a Codemirror instance.  The data may then be modified and toggled back to a grid display.  This is a way for the user to paste in copied data from Excel, for instance.  It is also currently the only way to change column headers or add columns.  Other component types that normally expose their data via HTML (such as the Document component, which defines global document settings), can be toggled to show the data as JSON, then modified or pasted and toggled back.

The point is to strike a balance between GUI manipulation and programmatic manipulation.  GUI and JSON are two ways of representing the same underlying data, and the user is free to toggle between the representations.

[Discuss `getText()`, etc.?]


##### Grids

One of the earliest motivations of this project was the frustration of not being able to properly name columns in Excel.  Here we have named columns, and grid data is properly referred to by name, rather than by A1 bullshit.  A grid typically consists of a list of objects - each row is an object (0-indexed) and each column is a field.  To refer to a data field, you write `get(componentName)[objectIndex].fieldName`, example `get('foo')[0].bar`.  We can also store the data as a list of lists, which we will call a `matrix`.  A matrix will be displayed without column headers.  Data can be accessed with `get(componentName)[objectIndex][fieldIndex]`, such as `get('foo')[0][0]`.

Now, the implementation of various aspects of Handsontable present a lot of complications to our goals.  For instance, column headers are uneditable in normal operation.  That's sort of a good thing - other ways of implementing column headers would rely on convention (such as "column headers go in the first row"), but there wouldn't be anything special about the cells containing column headers.  What I wish happened is that column headers retain their special status, except that they can be selected and edited like any other cell.  But arrow keys, for instance, would not be able to move the selection to a column header.  It would have to be specially clicked on.  But I'd also like a pony.  What we have are fixed column headers, which means we need a means of changing those names if we want.  The way we do this is to toggle to TSV, change the name, and then toggle back.

Another problem is that you can't add a column to a grid with column headers.  I wish Handsontable would provide a default column name, but that would imply editable column headers and they don't have that.  So the only way to add a column is again by toggling to TSV.

Matrixes avoid all these problems - every cell is the same, every cell is editable, you can insert columns.  But the columns cannot have names, they must be indexed by numbers.

In addition, Handsontable is limited to displaying 1000 rows.  If the data is larger, it displays an internally operated scrollbar.  This isn't terrible, but it's clear that Handsontable is not for big data.  In order to store and display larger amounts of data, we have a `tsv` component type, where the data is basically just displayed in TSV format in a `<pre>` element.  This is fairly lightweight as far as the DOM is concerned.

This is a litany of compromises.




##### Codemirror

Codemirror, by Marijn Haverbeke, is the library used to display and edit text.


##### Handsontable

Handsontable is the library used to display and edit grid data.




#### Canvas

It is desirable to have a WYSIWYG document display that can be exported to PDF.  To implement this, Hyperbench has a canvas library that translates HTML Canvas commands to PDF commands.  Client code can just use the HTML Canvas interface, and the commands will both draw to a `<canvas>` element on screen as well as be converted to PDF commands and stored in a shadow PDF file.

Canvas also has limited SVG support, but this has been neglected in favor of PDF.


##### Fonts

We use the library opentype.js to read and draw fonts.  Currently we provide two free fonts when the app loads - a serif and a sans, both from Adobe under a libre license.  There are a few routes and options for delivery of the font file:

1. Deliver fonts on app load - easy, but heavyweight
2. Deliver fonts on request when used (user specifies a name) - harder, adds to delay when drawing a document for the first time, but lightweight
3. User uploads font

Getting text to display identically between the canvas and PDF turned out to be pretty difficult.  The native canvas handling of fonts is inadequate in two ways: first, I haven't found a way to get the canvas to use a user- or app- provided font file.  It might not be possible.  Also, setting font size behaves unpredictably - how many pixels 12pt is converted to is dependent on unknown factors, and we need precise control.  So, we generally don't use the native canvas `fillText()` function.  Text is drawn on screen by opentype.js, which reads the font file and draws the bezier curves.  The same method can be used to draw text in PDF - just let opentype.js draw the bezier curves.  But this results in a huge PDF file.  So we draw text natively in PDF, storing the font file in the PDF document and using the standard text display functions.


##### Transformations

One of the important tasks the canvas must handle is dealing with coordinate transformations.  There are many sources of coordinate transformations:

1. The `<canvas>` origin is at the top left, whereas the PDF origin is at the bottom left.  This requires a transform from the very start.
 a. Of course, this means that the PDF y-axis is flipped, which means that the PDF will draw text upside down - to avoid this you have to re-flip the y-axis with a text coordinate transformation (the Tm command, I believe).
2. The different scales - all user drawing commands are denominated in cubits, which then must be transformed into pixels and points.  The commands basically diverge - one copy gets transformed into pixels and ultimately CanvasRenderingContext2D calls, and another copy gets transformed into points and implemented via PDF drawing commands.
3. User code can have arbitrary transformations, which must play nicely with the transforms in #1 and #2.

##### Mathjax

There is some support for MathJax via the `drawMath()` function.  I've managed to keep asynchronity out of this app otherwise, but MathJax requires it - fortunately I've managed to contain the infection to a few rendering functions.  Calls to drawMath unfortunately do not draw directly onto the canvas, but rather are sent to MathJax.  The SVG shapes returned to the callback are then translated to canvas commands (this was implemented before I knew about Path2D, so it could be rewritten to be much shorter - still need to parse and deal with transformations, though) and drawn on screen / on PDF.


### Document components

Alongside components that hold code and data, there are special component types that handle the specifics of documents.  These components will deal with document settings, page settings, and drawing onto the document.

#### The Document component

The presence of a Document component in a workbook indicates that a Canvas/PDF document will be drawn.  A Document component is optional - the workbook functions fine without one, and the user can just draw arbitrary HTML to the output <div>.  But I feel that breaking backwards compatibility with paper is the worst mistake HTML makes, and is a big part of why scientists and businesspeople don't use HTML to communicate.  Even if paper will finally be eliminated by iPads, you still need to use some sort of document format - PDF isn't going anywhere.

The variables defined in the Document component include page size, screen resolution, and userspace unit definition.  There are three measurement units that will be used in a document: *pixels* for displaying on the screen, *points* for displaying on the page, and what we call *cubits* for the unit used by user code.  The user defines the number of cubits that will make up an inch, centimeter, etc.  For example, a user may decide to define 1 inch = 100 cubits, which is easy to work with.  Points are fixed at 72 points per inch.  Pixels per inch can be set to an arbitrary number.

#### The Section component

The Section component defines a sequence of continuous content, such as chapter of text.  The Section will separate the content into pages for PDF export, but the Section is treated as one continuous segment for user interface purposes.  This means that the Section will be represented by a single `<canvas>` element, so that dragging content across the section can be done without having to drag content across multiple `<canvas>es`.  This might become a problem if users want to define very large Sections, because browsers have hard limits on the size of the `<canvas>`.  To mitigate this, the user can pick a lower resolution so that the `<canvas>` takes up fewer pixels.  Page breaks are delineated by dashed lines on the continuous `<canvas>`.  Margins and portrait/landscape orientation are defined in the Section component.

Variables defined in the Section component:

* margin
* internalMargin (gap between columns, possibly margin from images/captions)
* nColumns
* linePitch
* indent
* font
* etc.

It would be nice to have a way to directly edit the text displayed on the document.  The indirect method (of editing text on the components side, and then seeing it displayed on the document side) is fine, but it is serious change from the direct manipulation people do in Word.  But the whole notion of reimplementing direct manipulation text editors on a canvas is self-evidently a tarpit.


#### Layout

The layout algorithm looks first at the block components in a section.  These have a defined position and size - they are drawn onto the page first, and then the paragraph text fills in the gaps.  We use the Knuth-Plass linebreaking algorithm, as implemented by Bram Stein.


#### Ordering of content

Content is drawn to the document in the same order as their corresponding components.  To rearrange Sections, just rearrange the Section components, and the rendering of the document will follow.  Components like images, charts, etc. belong to the nearest Section above them.  As you read the components from top to bottom, the block components belong to the most-recently encountered Section.

* Section 1
* Image A
* Section 2
* Image B

So if the components are ordered as above, Image A will be drawn in Section 1 and Image B will be drawn in Section 2.  If you want to move Image B to Section 1, just reorder the components like so:

* Section 1
* Image A
* Image B
* Section 2

Since the Section is treated as one continuous sequence of pages, the page index of an image can just be encoded as the y-coordinate.



### Component types

Block components include tables, lists, charts, and images.

Component subclasses - additional constraints on the data
Component.Grid -> BarChartData, LineChartData, TextData, Footnotes, Endnotes, SectionHeaders, Captions, etc.
Component.Text -> Document, Markdown, ProseMirror, Graphviz, Variables, BarChartLinked, LineChartLinked


#### Charts

One of the problems we face is mapping data from its natural format to a format readable by charts.  This is mostly about column headers - data in its native format might have column headers such as latitude and longitude, but a scatter chart needs to know x and y.  Plus there is often a mapping between the native field and the xy-coordinate.

There are basically two ways to do it:

1. Have a separate data grid specifically for the chart, with built-in headers for x, y, height, width, etc.
2. Define a mapping from the arbitrary header names in the native data grid to the graphical meaning

Option #1 has the benefit of being explicit, and can be implemented with cross-grid formulas (which are not implemented yet, but could be).  The problem is that it is redundant, requiring essentially an entire second copy of intermediate data.

Option #2 saves space, but it would need to be designed.  People would need a way to specify grid+column, and possibly define a mapping formula.

We could also imagine a third option, often used in Excel:

3. Allow the user to add x, y, columns to the native data grid.  This is a pretty good compromise, except that adding columns to a grid is not well supported (requiring an entire paste-in).


#### Formulas

The current formula implementation requires A1-style cell references, which conflicts with our desire to use meaningful column headers.

Possible ways to resolve this conflict:

1. Fix the formula implementation - obviously the best solution, also probably the hardest
2. Add FormulaGrids as a component type, which will use A1-references
3. Do what one does in Excel, and use the first data row to hold your column headers.  Clunky in all the same ways.



#### Captions

captions could be an inherent part of the Image component - but there are questions as to top/left/bottom/right
and also, charts and such could use captions too, but there's no straightforward way to put the caption in the component
in the spirit of having data in the components and presodata in the Document component, we could put caption placement data in the Document component
the caption can just be a single-line `<input>` right below the header line for the component
left/right/top/bottom and the size of those boxes can be adjusted in the GUI

indeed, paragraph components could have the section header done the same way as captions

axis labels (and chart titles, etc.) and chart footnotes and such should be Text objects that are sub-boxes of the chart



so there are 3 ways to store Text Content in the components:
1. each Text gets its own component - this is pretty damned unwieldy, although it could be mitigated by single line text inputs rather than textareas
2. the Texts get put into a grid, either one grid for the whole document, or one grid per section
3. the Texts are put directly into the document JSON - this is, basically, not data-centric enough

then there's the possibilitiy of different text grids according to function: one for section titles, one for footnotes, one for endnotes, one for captions, etc.  in these cases, the Content added would be presented as different objects, but the corresponding Components would be of similar forms

choices for storing Text data:
1. store all Text info in the document JSON
2. one grid for the entire document - specify section/page explicitly
3. one grid for each section - specify page explicitly
4. one component for each Text object
for now, we'll go with 1
but 2 would probably be a better option - subject Texts to formulas, variable replacement, etc
AddText adds a line to the global table
but AddText the button is a poor choice - better to click directly on the document, in AddText mode or something
and having the single-table Text infrastructure allows us to structure footnotes, captions, section headers, etc. in the same way
footnotes/endnotes/section headers are definitely the result of computations, so they need to be in a grid or otherwise computable


#### Variables

Variables are how we add intelligence and interactivity to numbers embedded inline within paragraph text.

First thoughts about the interface: when you mouse over a variable in text, display the cell outline.  Click to edit the cell, and you get a formula.

See the *Tangle* library, by Bret Victor.





#### Handlers

Mouse event handling is done by the Box abstraction, which is used by many types of components, as well as the handlers defined by each individual component type.

Handlers for dealing with mouse entry and exit of the owned region are named `onhover` and `dehover` by convention.

##### Box

Most block components are roughly box-shaped, and so can outsource handling of common functions, such as moving and alignment, to the Box abstraction.  The Box also deals with detecting and acting appropriately when the mouse enters and leaves its territory.  The UI for movement/alignment is the 9 handles drawn on the box.  The user grips a handle and drags to move the box.  The act of gripping a given handle also changes the alignment of the Box - to center the box both horizontally and vertically, grab the handle in the center of the box.  To align to top/left, grab the handle in the top left.

Dragging a handle across the background of the Section can be governed by a snap grid, whose spacing and look and feel can be customized in the Document component.  The Section is responsible for drawing the snap grid.  Draw order is important here - you want to draw the text background first, then draw the snap grid, then draw the handles over top of the snap grid.

The object currently hovered has control of all handlers for the canvas - `onmousemove`, `onmousedown`, `onmouseup`.  Which means it must detect when the mouse leaves its box, and then call `this.dehover()`, then `parent.onhover(e)`.  It might be that the mouse has also left the parent box, so the parent should immediately check for dehover itself.

On clearing: the general principle is that we don't want to do page redraws on mousemoves (excepting drags, that is - page redraw on drag is necessary).
So far, all we do on mousemove is draw handles and arrows on hover, and then clear them when the mouses moves on.  So handles and arrows have their own clear functions that draw a saved patch of canvas.  But for anything involving a mousedown, just redraw the whole section.

##### Arrows

Single-dimensional scaling changes are handled by Arrows.  The canonical example is the height of a bar chart column, which is some scaled factor of the underlying data.  Besides the sizing of graphical elements, Arrows can also be used for gaps and margins between graphical elements.  An Arrow has its own box that draws an arrow onhover.  Then onmousedown and onmousemove, the arrow expands/contracts and the graphical element is scaled accordingly.


#### Undo

All nonvolatile changes will ultimately modify the text representation of the component.  Which means that any changes can be undone by either

1. storing the previous JSON, or
2. storing a command which will reverse the change.

Clearly, #1 is easier to implement but requires more storage space, and #2 is harder but uses less storage.  Therefore, we should start with #1 and implement #2 when we run up against resource limits.



#### Django app



#### Deployment

##### Heroku

##### nginx/uWSGI



#### Sandboxing

If we are forced to draw the sandbox around the document, excluding components, that raises many questions:

1. Newly uploaded component data still needs to be able to get into the sandbox somehow.  Perhaps this one-directional movement is easy.
2. We will no longer be able to self-modify the components with user code.  Which, like, is fine.  There are other ways, like outputting intermediate data to the sandbox and then hand copypasting it back to the components.
